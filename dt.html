Model the following University information system as a graph model, and
answer the following queries using Cypher.
University has various departments like Physics, Geography, Computer etc.
Each department conducts various courses and a course may be conducted by
multiple departments. Every course may have recommendations provided by
people.
1. Identify the labels and relationships, along with their properties, anddraw
a high-level Graph model. [3]
2. Create nodes and relationships, along with their properties, and
visualize your actual Graph model. [3]
3. Answer the following Queries :
a. List the details of all the departments in the university. [3]
b. List the names of the courses provided by Physics department. [3]
c. List the most recommended course in Geography department. [4]
d. List the names of common courses across Mathematics and
computer department. [4]

# Step 1: Open MongoDB    using mongosh
mongosh

# Step 2: Create a database for the Library information system
use library_information_db

# Step 3: Create collections for students, books, and book types
db.books.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Data Structures", type: "text", rating: 4.5 },
  { _id: 2, name: "Introduction to Algorithms", type: "reference", rating: 4.7 },
  { _id: 3, name: "Advanced Databases", type: "bibliography", rating: 4.3 },
  { _id: 4, name: "Artificial Intelligence", type: "text", rating: 4.9 },
  { _id: 5, name: "Machine Learning", type: "reference", rating: 4.8 }
])

db.students.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "John", books_bought: ["text", "reference"], recommendations: { "Data Structures": 5, "Introduction to Algorithms": 4.5 } },
  { _id: 2, name: "Alice", books_bought: ["text", "bibliography"], recommendations: { "Artificial Intelligence": 5, "Advanced Databases": 4 } },
  { _id: 3, name: "Bob", books_bought: ["reference"], recommendations: { "Machine Learning": 4.5 } }
])

# Step 4: Write the Cypher queries to fetch the required results

# a. List the books of type “text”
db.books.aggregate([
  { $match: { type: "text" } },
  { $project: { name: 1, type: 1 } }
])

# b. List the name of students who bought both "text" and "reference" types of books
db.students.aggregate([
  { $match: { books_bought: { $all: ["text", "reference"] } } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# c. List the most recommended book type
db.books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$type", avg_rating: { $avg: "$rating" } } },
  { $sort: { avg_rating: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 },
  { $project: { _id: 0, type: "$_id", avg_rating: 1 } }
])

# d. List the students who bought more than one type of book
db.students.aggregate([
  { $match: { books_bought: { $size: { $gte: 2 } } } },
  { $project: { name: 1 } }
])

# Step 5: Exit MongoDB   
exit
